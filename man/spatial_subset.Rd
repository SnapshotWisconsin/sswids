\title{Spatially Subset Camera Site Locations}
\usage{
spatial_subset(datalist, sf_layer, filter_statement)
}
\arguments{
\item{datalist}{list object containing location, effort, and detection dataframes.}

\item{sf_layer}{sf polygon object}

\item{filter_statement}{character string, to be passed along to \code{filter()} to subset spatial layer}
}
\value{
data frame
}
\description{
Spatially subset camera site locations using an sf polygon object. There may
be times where it doesnâ€™t make sense to include data from the entire Snapshot
Wisconsin camera network, and we should spatially subset camera locations. For
example, we may want to only consider the Northern Forest Zone instead of the
entire state of Wisconsin. We can filter locations, detections, and effort
based on a spatial layer, like deer management unit.
