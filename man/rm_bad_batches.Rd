\title{Removes impossible dates outside the start and end active dates of a batch}
\usage{
rm_bad_batches(datalist)
}
\arguments{
\item{datalist}{list object containing location, effort, and detection dataframes. Right now this is specifically set up to handle output of rm_noloc_data function}
}
\value{
a list object containing location, effort, and detection dataframes with bad batches filtered out
}
\description{
At least some of these are errors because of the location start date not
overlapping with the batch start and end dates. The batch START_ACTIVE_DATE
and END_ACTIVE_DATE and the location START_DATE and END_DATE are both assessed
when determining start_date and end_date for effort from the sswidb_effort
function.Find all batches that have detections outside of batch start and end
active dates and remove those batches and all associated detections and locations.
