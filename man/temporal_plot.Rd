\usage{
temporal_plot(
  conn,
  df,
  mgmtlayer,
  days_active_threshold,
  ppn_class_threshold,
  spatialgroup
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{connection to the Snapshot database from \code{connect_to_sswidb()}}

\item{df}{a sf data frame output by the data pull workflow}

\item{mgmtlayer}{spatial layer from \code{list_spatial_layers()}}

\item{days_active_threshold}{Numeric, scalar. Minimum number of days a camera needs to have been functioning within an occasion for a cam site id x year x occasion to be included in temporal plot.}

\item{ppn_class_threshold}{Numeric, scalar. Proportion of photos classified within an occasion required for a cam site id x year x occasion to be included in a temporal plot.}

\item{spatialgroup}{character, column name in mgmtlayer that denotes either the zone names or county names to summarize camera data by. Not built to handle more than one spatial group}
}
\description{
Use year round data to decompose detections into seasonal and trend components for
possible use in annual decision making products. Meant to be used with data pulled
year round and with > 4 years of data or it will throw errors. Returns a list of
ggplot objects based on the number of species. Can only be used with one spatial
layer by which to summarise.
