\title{Pulls in effort data from database}
\usage{
query_effort(conn, prec, grid, daterange = NULL, remove0Timelapse = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{connection to database returned by \code{sswids::connect_to_sswidb()}}

\item{prec}{precision of classifications. Should be set to 0 or 0.95. 0.95
indicates final data and returns class_final_trigger_count column
in output data while 0 indicates data that is classified but includes
classifications that don't meet accuracy standard, resulting in
class_effort_trigger_count column being included in output.}

\item{grid}{specified as character vector. What camera grids to pull effort
info for (e.g. "SSWI").}

\item{daterange}{preferably a data frame of start and end dates, with columns
"start_date" and "end_date" as created by \code{sswids::create_season_dates()}.
Can accommodate same ranges across years. The date range to
pull the effort for. If not provided defaults to January 1st
to December 31st of the previous year.}

\item{remove0Timelapse}{Logical, should rows with 0 timelapse photos be removed
from the table. These rows indicate camera site/days
where no timelapse photo was taken despite programming.}
}
\value{
a nested data frame with daily camera effort information as well as
location and grid information.See details for more info.
}
\description{
Queries database for information about effort at camera sites,
including classification effort. Combines data from DS_LOCATION_EFFORT,
SSWI_GRID_REF, and SSWI_CAMERA_LOCATION based on specified arguments.
}
\details{
A column called season is created in the output indicating the time period
repeated across years from which data is pulled, is often synonymous with year
but possibly different if the time period of interest spans years (e.g. over
winter). It is created based on the number of rows in your daterange input.

Output is a nested table with camera-level information such as location sequence
number, lat, lon, and grid ID displayed across columns and effort data nested
within the effort list-column. See \code{tidyr::nest()} for more info.
